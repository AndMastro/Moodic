Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring <br>
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun <br>
Now the jingle hop has begun <br> <br>

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <br>
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square <br>
In the frosty air <br> <br>

What a bright time, it's the right time <br>
To rock the night away <br>
Jingle bell time is a swell time <br>
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh <br> <br>

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet <br>
Jingle around the clock <br>
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet <br> <br>

That's the jingle bell rock <br> <br>

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <br>
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square <br>
In the frosty air <br> <br>

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <br>
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun <br>
Now the jingle hop has begun <br> <br>

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <br>
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square <br>
In the frosty air <br> <br>

What a bright time, it's the right time <br>
To rock the night away (Rock the night away) <br>
Jingle bell time is a swell time <br>
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh <br>
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet <br>
Jingle around the clock <br> <br>

Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet <br>
That's the jingle bell <br>
That's the jingle bell <br>
That's the jingle bell (rock) <br> <br>

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock, whoa <br>
