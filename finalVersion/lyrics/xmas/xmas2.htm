Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <br>
But the very next day, you gave it away <br>
This year, to save me from tears <br>
I'll give it to someone special <br> <br>

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <br>
But the very next day, you gave it away <br>
This year, to save me from tears <br>
I'll give it to someone special (special) <br> <br>

Once bitten and twice shy <br>
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye <br>
Tell me baby do you recognize me? <br>
Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me <br> <br>

I wrapped it up and sent it <br>
With a note saying "I Love You" I meant it <br>
Now I know what a fool I've been <br>
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again <br> <br>

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <br>
But the very next day, you gave it away <br>
This year, to save me from tears <br>
I'll give it to someone special (special) <br> <br>

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <br>
But the very next day, you gave it away <br>
This year, to save me from tears <br>
I'll give it to someone special (special) <br> <br>

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart <br>
A man undercover but you tore him apart <br>
Maybe next year, <br>
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special <br>
Special, someone, someone <br>
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special <br> <br>

Who'll give me something in return <br>
I'll give it to someone, hold my heart and watch it burn <br> <br>

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special <br>
I thought you were here to stay <br>
How can love be for a day? <br>
I thought you were someone special, gave you my heart <br> <br>

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone <br>
Last Christmas I gave you my heart <br>
You gave it away <br>
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone <br>
