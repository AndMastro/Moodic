Ho, ho, ho... <br> <br>

Shake up the happiness <br>
Wake up the happiness <br>
Shake up the happiness <br>
It's Christmas time <br> <br>

There was a story that I was told <br>
And I want to tell the world before I get too old <br>
And don't remember it, so let's December it <br>
And reassemble it, oh yeah <br> <br>

Once upon a time in a town like this <br>
A little girl made a great big wish <br>
To fill the world full of happiness <br>
And be on Santa's magic list <br> <br>

Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br>
Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br>
Ho, ho, ho, <br>
Ho, ho, ho, <br>
It's Christmas time <br> <br>

At the same time miles away <br>
A little boy made a wish that day <br>
That the world would be okay <br>
And Santa Clause would hear him say <br>
I got dreams and I got love <br>
I got my feet on the ground and family above <br>
Can you send some happiness with my best <br>
To the rest of the people of east and the west <br> <br>

And maybe every once in a while <br>
You give my a grandma a reason to smile <br>
'Tis the season to smile <br>
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style <br> <br>

And let me meet a girl one day <br>
That wants to spread some love this way <br>
We can let our souls run free <br>
And she can open some happiness with me <br> <br>

Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br>
Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br> <br>

I know you're out there <br>
I hear your reindeer <br>
I see the snow where <br>
Your boots have been <br> <br>

I'm gonna show them <br>
So they will know then <br>
Then love will grow and <br>
They believe again <br> <br>

Shake it up (shake it up), shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br>
Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br>
Ho, ho, ho, <br>
Ho, ho, ho, <br>
It's Christmas time <br> <br>

Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br>
Shake it up, shake up the happiness <br>
Wake it up, wake up the happiness <br>
Come on all, it's Christmas time <br> <br>

Ho, ho, ho, <br>
Ho, ho, ho, <br>
Ho, ho, ho, <br>
It's Christmas time  <br>
