I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
There is just one thing I need <br>
I don't care about the presents <br>
Underneath the Christmas tree <br>
I just want you for my own <br>
More than you could ever know <br>
Make my wish come true oh <br>
All I want for Christmas is you <br> <br>

I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
There is just one thing I need, and I <br>
Don't care about the presents <br>
Underneath the Christmas tree <br>
I don't need to hang my stocking <br>
There upon the fireplace <br>
Santa Claus won't make me happy <br>
With a toy on Christmas day <br> <br>

I just want you for my own <br>
More than you could ever know <br>
Make my wish come true <br>
All I want for Christmas is you <br> <br>

I won't ask for much this Christmas <br>
I won't even wish for snow, and I <br>
I just wanna keep on waiting <br>
Underneath the mistletoe <br> <br>

I won't make a list and send it <br>
To the North Pole for Saint Nick <br>
I won't even stay awake <br>
To hear those magic reindeer click <br> <br>

'Cause I just want you here tonight <br>
Holding on to me so tight <br>
What more can I do <br>
Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you <br> <br>

All the lights are shining <br>
So brightly everywhere <br>
And the sound of children's <br>
Laughter fills the air <br> <br>

And everyone is singing <br>
I hear those sleigh bells ringing <br>
Santa won't you bring me <br>
The one I really need <br>
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly <br> <br>

I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
This is all I'm asking for <br>
I just wanna see my baby <br>
Standing right outside my door <br> <br>

I just want you for my own <br>
More than you could ever know <br>
Make my wish come true <br>
Baby all I want for Christmas is you <br> <br>

All I want for Christmas is you, baby <br>
