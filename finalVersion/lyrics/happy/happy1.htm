I don't mind<br>
Letting you down easy but just give it time<br>
If it don't hurt now, but just wait, just wait a while<br>
You're not the big fish in the pond no more<br>
You are what they're feeding on<br><br>

So what are you gonna do<br>
When the world don't orbit around you<br>
So what are you gonna do<br>
When the world don't orbit around you<br><br>

Ain't it fun<br>
Living in the real world<br>
Ain't it good<br>
Being all alone<br><br>

Where you're from<br>
You might be the one who's running things<br>
Well you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want<br>
See it's easy to ignore trouble<br>
When you're living in a bubble<br><br>

So what are you gonna do<br>
When the world don't orbit around you<br>
So what are you gonna do<br>
When nobody wants to fool with you<br><br>

Ain't it fun<br>
Living in the real world<br>
Ain't it good<br>
Being all alone<br>
Ain't it good to be on your own<br>
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one<br>
Ain't it good to be on your own<br>
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one<br>
Ain't it fun<br>
Living in the real world<br><br>

Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on you're own, in the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on you're own, in the real world<br><br>

Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on you're own, in the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on you're own, in the real world<br><br>

Ain't it fun, ain't it fun<br>
Baby now you're one of us<br>
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun, ain't it fun<br><br>

Ain't it fun<br>
Living in the real world<br>
Ain't it good, ain't it good<br>
Being all alone<br>
Ain't it fun<br>
Living in the real world<br>
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)<br>
Ain't it good, ain't it good<br>
Being all alone<br><br>

Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on your own, in the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on your own, in the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on your own, this is the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on your own,<br>
In the real world (This is the real world, this is the real world)<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on your own, in the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
'Cause you're on your own, in the real world<br>
Don't go crying to your mama<br>
Don't go crying<br>
