I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure <br>
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door <br>
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down <br>
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around <br> <br>

I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
And don't it feel good <br> <br>

Hey, alright now <br>
And don't it feel good, hey <br> <br>

I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true <br>
And I don't want to spend my whole life, just waiting for you <br>
Now I don't want you back for the weekend <br>
Not back for a day, no no no <br>
I said baby I just want you back <br>
And I want you to stay (Oh yeah now!) <br> <br>

I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
And don't it feel good <br> <br>

Hey, alright now <br>
And don't it feel good (Yeah!) <br>
And don't it feel good <br> <br>

Walking on sunshine <br>
Walking on sunshine <br> <br>

I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real <br>
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real <br> <br>

I'm on sunshine baby (Ow! Oh yeah!) <br>
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow!) <br> <br>

I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!) <br>
And don't it feel good (Hey! Alright now!) <br>
And don't it feel good (I'll say it I'll say it I'll say it again now) <br>
And don't it feel good (Hey yeah now!) <br>
And don't it feel good (Don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it) <br>
Feel good <br>
And don't it feel good <br>
And don't it feel good <br>
And don't it feel good <br>
And don't it feel good <br>
Now don't it feel good <br>
