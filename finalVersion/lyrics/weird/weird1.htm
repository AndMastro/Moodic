When I kiss a cutie no matter who <br>
I'm in trainin' for you <br>
If I hug a beauty, honest and true <br> <br>

I'm in trainin' for you <br>
Why sweetheart, you must realize <br>
My arms need the exercise <br>
I'll be in condition when I get through <br>
I'm in trainin' for you <br>
Somebody told me the pros want you (?) <br>
We have to watch every play <br>
So if I'm practicin', I'm not to blame <br>
I must improve every day <br>
If you see me neckin' somebody new <br>
I'm in trainin' for you <br>
Learning every second just what to do <br>
I'm in trainin' for you <br>
You're sincere of that I'm sure <br>
You don't want no amateur <br>
What I learn from others I'll teach you too <br>
I'm in trainin' for you <br>
