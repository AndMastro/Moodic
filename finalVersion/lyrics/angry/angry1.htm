Welcome to the truth; a life that's not your own. <br>
Controlled by labor, printed paper and the corruptors of the world. <br>
Synthetic lies collect our minds to the beast. <br>
We've had the rug pulled from under our feet. <br>
Media terrorists thrive on deceit, <br>
spoonfeeding bullshit served by elite societies harnessing fear as a weapon. <br> <br>

The time has come for all to see, <br>
the man behind the curtain cast into disease. (into disease) <br> <br>

Take back the light. <br>
It's a dangerous place we're headed for if we accept defeat. <br>
Now we know it's a show they've been running from below. <br>
Burn it down until the ground beneath the faulty entity is glistening <br>
under the wings of a golden era. <br>
Listening to the hate they've created inside us, we grow. <br>
As we reduce their religion to bones. <br>
Yes, we reduce them all to bones. <br> <br>

The time has come for all to see, <br>
the man behind the curtain writhe in self defeat. (defeat) <br>
When will the world seek truth within? <br>
The eye in silence grants the knowledge to begin. (to begin) <br> <br>

Reverse what's lost awake the song within you. <br>
Rejoice aloud. Let these words imbue. <br>
Reverse what's lost awake the song within you. <br>
Rejoice aloud. Let these words imbue. <br> <br>

Shape the future. <br>
Sifting power back in the hands of the common man. <br>
Give them hell for existence. <br>
Pouring blood on the path they've set in stone, <br>
as we reclaim our position to the throne. <br>
Yes, we reduce them all to bones! <br>
