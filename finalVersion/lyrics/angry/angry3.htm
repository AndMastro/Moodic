In the face of defeat <br>
There's no retreat! <br>
And what will become of the day, its do or die, <br>
Sick and tired of living lies <br>
There is no living in this seldom considerate, life. <br> <br>

Trust, your neighbors <br>
Trust, instincts <br>
Trust that no1 knows all the answers <br>
Why live a life so displeasing <br>
a signed contract <br>
On the day of our birth. <br>
Enslaved till the day we die, no peace of pie, just a wasted sacrifice. <br> <br>

this old system, <br>
could be a past time but its, obscuring freedom <br>
We're devoting our lives to being free <br>
join us to <br>
we'll make this the best it can be! <br>
This will be! <br> <br>

We're living for nothing, there's a better system <br>
We're in a trap, <br> 
Take a leaf outa my book its a better read than anything that you find in this god forsaken land. <br>
As we slave in no mans land, shifting time with broken hands <br> <br>

Rise to your full, potential is essential for a positive move, if you want this we should make this move <br>
As we slave in no mans land, shifting time with broken hands <br>
We want this, we need this, if we want this we should make this move! <br> <br>

There's hope <br>
Catapult yourself into the assault. <br>
If we all do we'll come out on top <br>
And They will be overthrown! <br>
No stalling! We cant keep falling down! <br> <br>

As we follow the light, <br>
We're resistant to all the changes <br>
The strongest minds, replant society, <br>
Seed by seed, regrow this world, take the chance to set out, our goals <br>
Seed by seed. Stop this so called life. <br> <br>

The frustration deprives, the foundation defies our lives. <br>
I think the call is too strong, no point saving our lives, <br>
The frustration deprives, the foundation defies our lives. <br>
Everything remains the same, except me. <br>
