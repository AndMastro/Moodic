Strip away all the access components <br>
Unveil a picture one sought to hide <br>
Personalities are like fiction <br>
The derivative truth but with no substance <br>
Violence and hate, <br>
Nourishment, territory and mate. <br>
We are the product of some experiment <br>
While most live in ignorance <br>
Some cant except <br> <br>

The last thing we see is obsession, depth of insanity <br> <br>

Follow the source into the ground <br>
Feeling all vibration flow inside of you <br>
We create the sound <br>
Like our fathers long before us <br>
We've forgotten how <br> <br>

Sun down <br>
Swiftly a less passive creature emerges <br>
Mark the august steps <br>
We'll shine the way <br>
Still the path remains the same <br>
Some may find their own way <br> <br>

Forever like me thirst for a pool of consistency <br> <br>

Catch a bug for knowledge and the structure comes down <br>
A counter intuitive attack <br>
Speak no evil and watch it flourish <br>
In a current state of madness <br>
