Lets say sunshine for everyone <br>
But as far as I can remember <br>
We've been migratory animals <br>
Living under changing weather <br> <br>

Someday we will foresee obstacles <br>
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard <br>
Today we will sell our uniform <br>
Live together, live together <br> <br>

We played hide and seek in waterfalls <br>
We were younger, we were younger <br>
We played hide and seek in waterfalls <br>
We were younger, we were younger <br>
We played hide and seek in waterfalls <br>
We were younger, we were younger <br>
We played hide and seek in waterfalls <br>
We were younger, we were younger <br> <br> 

Someday we will foresee obstacles <br> 
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard <br> <br>
