Every child in Valoran has heard the tale before, <br>
About the cursed mummy boy who felt his heart no more. <br>
So sad and lorn, the helpless lad, Amumu was his name, <br>
He ventured out to find a friend and learn about his bane. <br> <br>

For many years, young Amumu traveled through the lands, <br>
Determined to make friends, if only they would understand, <br>
But even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home, <br>
His hope would disappoint him, and he would remain alone. <br> <br>

But then the curse began to whisper in his ear, <br>
And would confirm what was Amumuâ€™s biggest fear, <br>
It pledged that never shall someone become his friend, <br>
It pledged that he shall be alone until his end. <br> <br>

The sorrow and despair, <br> 
Became too much to bear. <br> <br>

The moment when Amumu realized what he had done, <br>
Too late it was, for him, for them, the evil curse had won. <br>
The anger and the anguish overwhelmed his fragile soul, <br> 
And caused a wicked tantrum that he never could control. <br>
